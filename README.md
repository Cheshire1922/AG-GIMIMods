**honey pls stop sharing in the discord**  
yes this is a public repo but im still trying to keep it on the low since most of these mods are sussy  

# GI-GIMIMods
 
 
I will post (mostly) OC mods for a certain anime game on here, use them with [3DMigoto GIMI](https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer)   

If I share someone's project, it was with permission and will give credits if they want or not  
  
We haven't heard of anyone getting banned from using 3DMigoto but there's always a risk, we aren't responsible

use them on a private server :)

# Changelog  
-03/11/22: Decided to make the mods as zip file instead of folders so that people don't have to download the entire archive everytime a new mod is out  
  
-31/10/22: Added 2 versions, merged all together, switch between them by pressing P on the keyboard  
-31/10/22:  Added new version of [Nahida Mod](https://github.com/Cheshire1922/GI-3DMigotoMods/tree/main/Mods/nsfw/Characters/Nahida)  
too lazy to add changelog of older stuff, but I'll keep it updated from now on, just to make it easier for people to download what they missed
