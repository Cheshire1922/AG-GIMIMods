# AG-GIMIMods
 
 
I will post (mostly) OC mods for a certain anime game on here, use them with [3DMigoto GIMI](https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer)   

If I share someone's project, it was with permission and will give credits if they want or not  
  
We haven't heard of anyone getting banned from using 3DMigoto but there's always a risk, we aren't responsible

use them on a private server :)

I may update my mods at any time w/o notice, just some slight improvement really, nothing much
