# What happened to this repo? (14/04/24)
 
It has been up for quite a while without any updates, none of these mods work anymore, so I moved them into the archive folder

However, I do plan on updating/improving everything eventually
I do not have any estimation as of now

It's possible that I move everything onto GameBanana/Kemono and share links here as well for more visibility
(github is such a pain to work with/updating and stuff)

------------
I'm gonna be honest I don't know how this repo has gotten so many favorites for mid mods but thank you everyone

I hope to do better stuff in the future, I still enjoy modding even though I've been insanely lazy to do anything
