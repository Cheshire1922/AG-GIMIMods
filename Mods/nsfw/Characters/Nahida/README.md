# New Version  
sorry this took a while, laziness, and mostly just me struggling to understand weight painting in blender  
Obviously can't show any preview here  
  
Again, one has a flat chest

# Old version  
One of them has the flat chest version since people like different things  
(Unfinished version, I believe the final one will be better)  
(Update: Changed download to external)
